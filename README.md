## Summary
This package is a lightweight means of working with data in a grid.  You can think of this as a lean spreadsheet with rows and columns.

It allows a single data class to be used to organize your data in a grid, with various output styles so you can easily get a `.csv` file or a `.xlsx` file.

See the code for more documentation.


## Excel (.xls) Support
1. For `.xlsx` files you will need to grab PHPExcel
2. This is easy using composer, just navigate to the root folder for loft_data_grids and type

        composer install


## Automated Tests
1. Download a copy of [simpletest](http://simpletest.org/) to the `tests` directory
2. Visit `tests/all_tests.php` in your browser to run all tests at once; or visit a single test file instead.
3. If you're getting forbidden errors, take a look at the `.htaccess` file.
